description = "Doors open at 6pm, kickoff slides and intro start at 7pm.  Participants will receive an email to vote on the game jam's theme.  Those needing teams will have an opportunity to pitch ideas and form or join teams as necessary.  You can even work solo if you want.  3 people is ideal, and we prefer teams stay below 5.  **Then it's time to start making games!**  Work as long as you can, while staying healthy and safe!  Overnight work is permitted, but we send people home around midnight."
